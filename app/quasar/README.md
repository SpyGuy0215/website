# Quasar Website
### shashp.dev/quasar

This is a website for my mobile application, Quasar. It's built using 
Next.js and Tailwind. The website is designed to be a beautiful, responsive
showcase for the features of the application to convince the user to
download it. 

Some of the most notable packages used in this project include:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - A library for creating animations in React applications.
- [HeroUI](https://www.heroui.com/) - A collection of pre-built components for Tailwind CSS.
- [React Bits](https://reactbits.com/) - A collection of useful React components and hooks.
