# Creating a Custom Cursor With React & GSAP

Ever wondered how to create cool custom cursors for your website? They're simpler than you might think.
In this post, I'll show you how to create a custom cursor using React and GSAP. If you want a preview of what the cursor
will look like and how it will behave, check out the [demo](https://shashp.xyz) on the main
page of this website. Try hovering over some of the links and buttons to see the cursor in action.

## Setting Up

First, let's create a new React app using Create React App. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by
running

```bash
npx create-react-app custom-cursor-react-gsap
```

Next, navigate to the project directory and install GSAP by running

```bash
npm install gsap
```

Navigate to the `src/page.js` file. This is where we will be writing our custom cursor logic.

## Step 1: Creating the Cursor Components

The cursor we'll be the creating today is actually _two_ parts: an outer (secondary) circle and an inner (primary)
circle. We can make both with divs. Go to the top level of your page structure and add the following code:

```jsx
<div id={'primaryCursor'} className={'bg-blue-300 fixed h-3 w-3 rounded-full z-30 pointer-events-none'}
     ref={primaryCursorRef}/>
<div id={'secondaryCursor'}
     className={'border-2 border-blue-400 fixed h-8 w-8 rounded-full z-20 pointer-events-none'}
     ref={secondaryCursorRef}/>
```

**This guide assumes you are using Tailwind, but if not, just apply the relevant classes to your components.**

You should note that the `pointer-events-none` class is applied to both cursors. This is because we don't want the
cursor to interfere with the user's ability to interact with the page. The `z-30` and `z-20` classes are used to ensure
that the primary cursor is always on top of the secondary cursor, and that the cursor is always on top of the page
content.

You can also see that both divs have refs attached to them. We will use these refs to update the position of the
cursors.

## Step 2: Adding Logic

Now we have our divs, but at the moment they're a bit...useless. We need to add some logic to make them follow the
actual mouse cursor around. We can do this by adding the following code to the `useEffect` hook in the `App` component:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    // whatever code above...
    document.addEventListener('mousemove', updateMouse);
    // and below...
});
```

We're calling the `updateMouse()` function whenever the mouse position moves - let's make that now!

```jsx
function updateMouse() {
    gsap.set('#primaryCursor', {
        x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY,
        xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50
    })
    gsap.to('#secondaryCursor', {
        x: e.clientX,
        y: e.clientY,
        duration: 0.5,
        ease: 'power2.out',
        xPercent: -50,
        yPercent: -50
    });
}
```

Let's breakdown what's happening here:

- We are using `gsap.set()` to _instantly_ set the position of the inner, primary circle. We are setting the `x` and `y`
  coordinates to the current mouse position, and the `xPercent` and `yPercent` to -50. This is because we want the
  cursor to be centered around the mouse position (the default would be the top-left corner of the div).
- We are using `gsap.to()` to animate the position of the outer, secondary circle. We are also setting the duration of
  the animation to 0.5 seconds, and the easing function to `power2.out`. This will create a fluid movement of this
  circle to the new position.

Yes, there are functions for more speedy updates contained within GSAP, but they are more complicated. I also found 
through testing that it really doesn't make that much of a difference; GSAP even concedes that in their docs. 

## Step 3: Final Touches
You might see one issue here: the actual user cursor is still there! This is a simple fix: Add this class the body of
your page:

```jsx
<body className={'cursor-none'}>
```

This should hide the user's cursor, leaving only the beautiful custom cursor visible. 

## Conclusion and Further Steps

And that's it! If you want to add even more effects to the cursor, like expanding and interacting with the divs below
it, you can read my follow-up tutorial on how to do that.

export default function MDXPage({children}) {
    return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>

}
