# Firefox's New Ad Setting & Its Important Privacy Implications


## The Basics
Seemingly just a month after they acquired the advertising-related company [Anonym](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-anonym-raising-the-bar-for-privacy-preserving-digital-advertising/),
Mozilla implemented a new feature into their popular Firefox web browser. Under the new "Website Advertising Preferences" section in the
Privacy and Security section of Firefox settings (go turn it off now if you haven't already!), you will be able to see a new setting called
"Allow websites to perform privacy-preserving ad measurement". Mozilla says its an "experimental" feature, but one can note
that its enabled on the latest *stable* version, Firefox 128, by default.

###### I have it turned off here, but it's on by default

## Why is it here?

Co-authored by Meta and **enabled by default**, this setting allows websites to track their ad performance. Notably, it does not allow
websites to track who you are, as the name suggests. However, it is something that *does not* benefit the end-user and is instead something
for the money-making ad agencies and buyers of the world to profit off of. They can now track how well their ads are doing on Firefox much
easier, which of course allows them to optimize them for their own profits.

The reason for adding this feature is really anyone's guess right now, as Mozilla has not released an official statement as to why they
have a non-privacy-focused feature enabled by default in their browser. However, it is likely that it is due to the acquisition of Anonym as
well as pressure from advertising agencies. Money is a powerful motivator, and it seems they might have caved into it.

Another bombshell is the exact reason regarding *why* the feature is opt-out. A Mozilla developer is quoted as saying that the feature is
enabled by default from Firefox 128 because its much easier for them to do that and for users to discover and turn off the feature through
the blog post and other internet sources than it is for Firefox to prompt users to turn it on.

## The Implications

Of course, this setting and feature in general is not too bad. You still have a reasonable amount of privacy under it, and it's not as bad
as other settings that are opt-out in other browsers. However, Firefox is widely regarded as one of the most privacy-focused mainstream
browsers, and this is certainly a step in the wrong direction. Given that they've let this go in, who knows what else they would add in
just for the benefit of ad agencies and buyers? Since it now is in their financial interest, Mozilla could easily turn into a fallen angel
in the world of internet privacy.
